- Currently reading "Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis" by Thomas L. Naps.
- Currently writing nothing that exciting. I've been quite enjoying solving practice problems in the above book though. If you are looking for DS&A problems which resemble real world issues, this book has a vast quantity of them. You can pick yourself up a copy online for sub $25. It's most likely cheaper and better than whatever online algo course you are looking at.
